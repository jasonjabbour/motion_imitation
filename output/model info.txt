Model 13:
	- discount factor: .99
	- training 60 million steps
	- reward function: penalize for yaw deviation 
	- add yaw, remove rates, and make more history
	- obs space size 42: IMU (roll, pitch, yaw) 3*6=18, last action = 8*3 = 24
	- remove butterworth filter (_enable_action_filter = False)
	- remove interpolation (_enable_action_interpolation = False)
	- include a dead zone for changes of less than 1 degree
	- adjust weights in reward function: (see notebook)
	- lateral friction range changed from [.5, 1.25] to [.05, .75]
	- feed back loop latency changed from [0.0, 0.04] to [0.0, 0.1]
	- added noise to IMU, .1 rad std
	- Changes made to observation_dictionary_to_array_wrapper.py, locomotion_gym_env.py, bittle.py, minitaur.py, locomotion_gym_config.py, robot_sensors.py, minitaur_env_randomizer_config.py

Model 11:
	- discount factor: .99
	- training 60 million steps
	- reward function: penalize for yaw deviation 
	- add yaw and yaw rate to observational space
	- obs space size 42: IMU (yaw and yaw rate), last action
	- remove butterworth filter (_enable_action_filter = False)
	- remove interpolation (_enable_action_interpolation = False)
	- include a dead zone for changes of less than 1 degree
	- adjust weights in reward function: (see notebook)
	- Changes made to observation_dictionary_to_array_wrapper.py, locomotion_gym_env.py, bittle.py, minitaur.py, locomotion_gym_config.py, robot_sensors.p, imitation_task.py

Model 10 (Best Straight direction):
	- discount factor: .99
	- training 60million steps
	- reward function: penalize for yaw deviation 
	- add yaw and yaw rate to observational space
	- obs space size 66
	- Changes made to robot_sensors.py and imitation_task.py (labeled with "NEW")
	- Very straight but small steps
